# MEEG-restingstate
Contains code to extract resting state networks from MEG and EEG data
Within this repository different analysis pipelines are provided to analyse MEG and EEG data and extract resting state networks
In particular it provides a pipeline for the extraction of resting state networks based on Brookes et al., 2011 PNAS (Files with Envelope_...) and based on
Florin and Baillet 2015 Neuroimage. For details on this please also consult the file SomeNotesOnmegPACAnalysis.txt.
The details on the implemented methods can be found on https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.29.441916v1.
